Commodore 64 Sprite Demo
========================

This project contains a small program written in Commodore 64 BASIC. The program demonstrates creating, displaying, and moving sprites around the screen.

The program is a (heavy) refactoring of a program from an [article about sprites on c64brain.com](https://www.c64brain.com/graphics/commodore-64-sprites/).

The article based its code on an example from the Commodore 64C Personal Computer System Guide.
